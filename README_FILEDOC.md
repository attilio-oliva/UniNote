# File structure
The file is a TODO compressed archive.  
It is structured using the following schema:

ðŸ“¦File  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚Attachments  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚Section1  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚Section2  
 â”— ðŸ“‚SectionX  
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œnote.document  
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚Group1  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œnote1.document  
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚GroupX  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œnoteX.document  

Details:
- Attachment contains files and images to be inserted in documents.
- Groups are optional. They provide a further way to aggregate notes.
- Documents filename are used for their title. In case the title is left empty, default name is TODO.
# File structure implementation
A file is made of multiple related xml subfiles.
- File structure: every uninote file has its structure defined in a proper xml document (Example in repository at assets/filename.xml) 
- Note content: every note has its content defined in a dedicated xml document (Example in repository at assets/doc.xml)
